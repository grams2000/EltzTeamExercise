I Threw a Apfelkuchen at the Porshe. 
The Porshe sped off towards Berlin, with a BWM tailing it. 
The Porshe driver dropped his Bratwurst after crossing the Hauptstrasse. 
The BMW driver went to the Biergarten for a drink. 
Inside the Porsche was the band Rammstein, on the way to the Flughafen.
All of the band members wore Lederhose, and decided to stop and see Eltz before continuing.
Eltz was great, and we took a lot of Gebaeck.
Everyone was getting very sweaty because there was no Klimaanlage in the car!
The Gebaeck were great so they left a great yelp review for the Baekerei.
